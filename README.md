# SmartTrafficIntersection
Another toy project of a traffic intersection controlled by a RL agent to optimize traffic flow

# Components
## Simulation Component
Lanes, Traffic Controllers, and Intersections, This should simulate traffic in a given intersection configuration, with the optoin to manually control the controller behaviour if dynamic (i.e. not a stop sign or a roundabout)

## AI Component
This is a Reinforcement Learning AI agent controlling traffic controller to optimize metrics 

## Visualiztion Component  
Visualize intersection in terms of lanes, controller status and traffic accumilation
